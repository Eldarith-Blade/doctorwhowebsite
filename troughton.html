    <p>
        Second Doctor has a darker, more cunning aspect to his personality â€” 
        one which he usually kept hidden in order to carry out his plans. Regenerating 
        when his first incarnation gave in to old age and fatigue following his fight with 
        the Cybermen, this new incarnation was the product of the Doctor's first regeneration.
